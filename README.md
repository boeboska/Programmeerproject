Project Proposal animal change
===============================

#### In this document you could read the proposal for the programming project about the animal change in The Netherlands between 2000-2016


Problem statement:
-----------------------
In the Netherlands there is a discussion about the amount of meat we eat. Some experts say that we eat to much meat. Eating to much meat is bad for climate, health and the animals we eat do not have a fun life.
For example: If you should not eat meat for 3 days on weekly basis, that would be equal to deleting 3.000.000 cars in The Netherlands.
It is therefore important that the consumers become aware of the current amount of meat they use.
